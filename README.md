# birthday_wisher_automation

Key Features and Functionality:

1. Data Management with Pandas:

I use the pandas library to manage a database of my friends' birthdays, including their names and birthdates. This database is stored in a CSV file for easy maintenance and accessibility.
2. Automated Birthday Detection:

On a daily basis, the script runs to check if any of my friends have a birthday that day. It compares the current date with the birthdates in the database to identify birthdays.
3. Personalized Birthday Wishes:

Once a birthday is detected, the script generates personalized birthday messages for each friend based on their name and a predefined template. This adds a personal touch to the wishes.
4. Sending Email Wishes with smtplib:

The smtplib library is used to automate the process of sending birthday wishes via email. The script connects to my email account, composes the birthday message, and sends it to the respective friend's email address.

6. Scheduler for Daily Execution:

To ensure the script runs automatically every day, I use a scheduler tool (e.g., cron job on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows) to trigger the script at a specific time.
7. Customization and Scalability:

The project is highly customizable, allowing me to update the birthday database or modify the birthday message template easily. It can be scaled to accommodate more friends and additional features if needed.
